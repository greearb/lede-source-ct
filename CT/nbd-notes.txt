ath10k-ct: Disable AHB support.
  Fix PKG_VERSION
  Put CT_MAKEDEFS after $(MAKE)

  ATH10K_DEBUG needs to be set based on CONFIG_PACKAGE_ATH_DEBUG
  not CONFIG_PACKAGE_MAC80211_DEBUGFS

  and you should rename the package to ath10k-ct

<greearb_> Can you suggest a better value for PKG_VERSION?
<nbd> the date of the commit that you're referencing
<greearb_> ok.  Should I change it each time I do a new commit?
<nbd> every time you update the package, yes
<greearb_> ok, sounds good.

You forgot to update PKG_MIRROR_HASH - you can automate this using make
package/ath10k-ct/check FIXUP=1

Please stop bumping PKG_SOURCE_DATE for no reason. It should reflect the
date of the commit you're referencing in PKG_SOURCE_VERSION, not the
date you made the change.
