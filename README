This is the buildsystem for the OpenWrt Linux distribution.

To build for apu2 (x86-64) with ath10k and ath9k with CT firmware
and drivers you can use this shortcut:

./buildme.sh -t x86_64

See more about CT ath10k firmware here:

http://www.candelatech.com/ath10k.php


Normal build process is also available:

Please use "make menuconfig" to choose your preferred
configuration for the toolchain and firmware.

You need to have installed gcc, binutils, bzip2, flex, python, perl, make,
find, grep, diff, unzip, gawk, getopt, subversion, libz-dev and libc headers.

Run "./scripts/feeds update -a" to get all the latest package definitions
defined in feeds.conf / feeds.conf.default respectively
and "./scripts/feeds install -a" to install symlinks of all of them into
package/feeds/.

Use "make menuconfig" to configure your image.

Simply running "make" will build your firmware.
It will download all sources, build the cross-compile toolchain, 
the kernel and all choosen applications.

To build your own firmware you need to have access to a Linux, BSD or MacOSX system
(case-sensitive filesystem required). Cygwin will not be supported because of
the lack of case sensitiveness in the file system.
